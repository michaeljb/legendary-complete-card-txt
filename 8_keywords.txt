[size=16][b]Keywords[/b][/size]

== Dark City ==

[b]Teleport[/b]: Instead of playing it, you may set aside a card with the keyword "Teleport". If you do, add it to your new hand at the end of your turn as an extra card.

[b]Bribe[/b]: You can fight villains with the keyword "Bribe" by spending any combination of Attack and/or Recruit. For example, you may play two S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents and two S.H.I.E.L.D. Troopers to fight the +4 Attack Maggia Goons."

[b]Versatile[/b]: When you play a card with the keyword "Versatile" you must first choose between Recruit and Fight. Once you have chosen, the card provides recruit or fight equal to the Versatile value. For example, Versatile 3 gives you +3 Recruit or +3 Attack.

== Fantastic Four ==

[b]Focus[/b]: When you play a card with a Focus ability, you can pay the cost on the left side of the arrow to get the effect on right side of the arrow. You can use that Focus ability as many times as you want for the rest of the turn. You can even play more Heroes, recruit, fight, then use the Focus ability more.
Note: You can use Focus abilities and still use the "Healing" ability on Wounds.

[b]Burrow[/b]: This means "Fight: If the Streets were empty, put this Villain back into the Streets." When you fight a Villain with Burrow, do all of that Villain's Fight effects. You rescue any Bystanders the Villain may have captured as normal. Then, if the "Streets" city space was empty, put that Villain back into the Streets space. If you fight a Villain with Burrow twice in a turn, you'll do that Villain's Fight effects twice. Cards that do something "when you defeat" a Villain still work if the Villain burrows to the Streets. When a Villain burrows to the Streets, it does not do any Ambush effects

[b]Cosmic Threat[/b]: If an enemy has Cosmic Threat: Ranged, that means: "For each Ranged card you reveal, this Enemy gets -3 Attack this turn." (An asterisk next to an Enemy's Attack number is to remind you that their Attack can change. The asterisk doesn't mean anything else.)

Galactus' Cosmic Threat means "Once per turn, choose Strength, Instinct, Covert, Tech or Ranged. For each card of that color you reveal, this Enemy gets -3 Attack for one fight this turn." If you try to fight Galactus a second time in the same turn, he will return to his full attack and you cannot use his Cosmic Threat ability a second time that turn.

== Paint the Town Red ==

[b]Wall-Crawl[/b]: "When you recruit this Hero, you may put it on top of your deck."
Remember: When you use Wall-Crawl to put a card on top of your deck, don't use any other abilities on that card until it gets drawn from your deck. If you "gain" a Hero through some special ability like Skrull Shapeshifters, you can't use Wall-Crawl because you didn't "recruit" that Hero.

[b]Feast[/b]: "Fight: KO the top card of your deck."
Carnage's Master Strike starts with "Feast on each player." That means each player does the "Feast" effect.
Note that Carnage's Master Strike is the only effect that feasts on every player. The "Maximum Carnage" Villains and Carnage's Mastermind Tactic each feast on only one player.

== Villains ==

[b]Demolish[/b]: Reveal the top card of the Ally (Hero) Deck, note its cost, and put it on the bottom of the Ally Deck. Each player reveals their hand and discards a card with that cost.

[b]Dodge[/b]: "During your turn, you may discard this card from your hand to draw another card." When you Dodge a card from your hand, ignore all the other text on that card. When you Dodge a card from your hand, you didn't "play" that card, so the Dodged card's Ally (Hero) Class/color doesn't help you use the Superpower abilities of other cards you play that turn. Some Allies in the Villains set count the number of cards you discarded this turn; this includes cards you discarded with Dodge.

[b]Elusive[/b]: "Elusive 6" means "You can only fight this Adversary if you have made at least 6 Recruit this turn." You don't have to spend that Recruit to fight this Adversary, you just have to have made that much Recruit this turn. You can still spend that Recruit on recruiting Allies (Heroes).

[b]X-Treme Attack[/b]: "This Adversary gets +1 Attack for each other Adversary in the city with X-Treme Attack."

== Guardians of the Galaxy ==

[b]Artifact[/b]: When you gain a Hero Artifact, put it in your discard pile like any other Hero card. When you draw that Artifact later in the game, you may play it in front of you and use its effects, usually once one each of your turns. This means you "control" that Artifact. At the end of your turn, when you discard all the cards you played that turn, the Artifacts you control stay in.
If a card effect during any player's turn asks you to "Reveal a Ranged Hero," you may reveal a Ranged Hero Artifact you control. Card effects that say "your Heroes" or "Heroes you have" include Hero Artifacts you control as well.
However, you only "played" an Artifact on the turn you put it out, so it only activates Superpower Abilities on the turn you play the Artifact, not every turn of the game.
If a card effect like Rogue, Chameleon, or Star-Lord would let you "copy" an Artifact card, then you can use that Artifact's "Once per turn" ability once, and there is no other effect.

== Fear Itself ==

[b]Thrown Artifact[/b]: These are Artifact cards that the player can "throw" at the perfect moment. To "throw" a Thrown Artifact, put it on the bottom of your deck and use its ability.
You can throw as many Artifacts as you want in a turn. You can only throw during your turn.
If a card effect like Rogue, Chameleon, or Star-Lord would let you "copy" a Thrown Artifact card, use that Artifact's "When you throw this" ability once, and there is no other effect. (Don't put anything on the bottom of your deck.)

[b]Uru-Enchanted Weapons[/b]: When you try to fight an enemy that has some number of Uru-Enchanted Weapons, reveal that many cards from the top of the Adversary Deck. That enemy immediately gains +Attack equal to the total Victory Points of all the cards you revealed. If you have enough Attack points to match the enemy's improved Attack, use them and defeat the enemy as normal. If you don't have enough Attack points, you don't defeat this enemy, you lose all your Attack points, and you can't fight anymore this turn.
Whether you defeat that enemy or not, put all the cards you revealed from the Adversary Deck on the bottom of that deck in random order.
Many of these enemies have a "[b]Fight or Fail[/b]:" effect. Do this effect if you defeat them or if the Uru-Enchanted Weapons cause you to fail to defeat them.
Once you start to fight an enemy, you can't play any more cards or throw any Artifacts until after that fight is complete. So remember to generate all the Attack points you can before you attack an enemy with Uru-Enchanted Weapons!
Flipping cards for Uru-Enchanted Weapons cannot end the game. If you run out of cards in the Adversary Deck, shuffle the cards you've revealed so far and keep revealing. (If there are no cards left in the Adversary Deck there is no Attack bonus.)

== Secret Wars Volume 1 ==

[b]Rise of the Living Dead[/b]: "Each player checks the top card of their Victory Pile. If that card is a Villain with a 'Rise of the Living Dead' ability, that Villain reenters the city."
(Mastermind Tactics never return this way.)
If you put a Villain with Bystanders into your Victory Pile, you choose the order.

[b]Cross-Dimensional Rampage[/b]: "Cross-Dimensional (Character) Rampage" means "Each player reveals one of their (Character) Heroes or a (Character) card in their Victory pile or gains a Wound." (Character) cards include any card with "(Character)" in its card name or Hero name.
"Hulk" cards additionally include "Maestro" and "Nul, Breaker of Worlds."
"Wolverine" cards additionally include any card with "Weapon X" or "Old Man Logan".

== Secret Wars Volume 2 ==

[b]Spectrum[/b]: Some cards have abilities like "Spectrum: Draw a card." You can use a card's Spectrum abilities only if you have at least 3 classes of Hero.
Grey S.H.I.E.L.D. Heroes, HYDRA Allies, New Recruits and Sidekicks don't have classes, so they don't help.
You can count all the classes you have among cards you played this turn and cards in your hand.

[b]Patrol[/b]: Some cards have abilities like "Patrol the Sewers: If it's empty, rescue a Bystander." When you play that card, you can use that ability only if that city space has no cards in it.
If that city space becomes empty later in the turn, it's too late to use the Patrol ability.
This can also say "Fight: Patrol the Bank: If it's empty, you get +2 Recruit. If it's not, you get +2 Attack."
Other cards let you patrol even stranger places, like the Escape Pile or a Victory Pile. Similarly, you can use those Patrol abilities if that place has no cards in it.
If a Mastermind or Scheme causes a city space not to exist, you can't patrol that space.

[b]Circle of Kung-Fu (and Quack-Fu)[/b]: "5th Circle of Kung-Fu" means "During your turn, this Villain has +5 Attack unless you reveal a Hero that costs 5 or more."
Likewise, the 7th Circle gets +7 Attack unless you reveal a Hero that costs 7 or more, etc.
If a Villain or Mastermind already has a Circle of Kung-Fu, and a Scheme gives them another one, only count the highest circle - don't add them up.

[b]Fateful Resurrection[/b]: On a Villain card, "Fight: Fateful Resurrection" means "Fight: Reveal the top card of the Villain Deck. If it's a Scheme Twist or Master Strike, this Villain reenters the city."
If a Villain resurrects this way, you still rescue its Bystanders and do its other Fight effects.
The Villain pushes into the Sewers and does any Ambush abilities as normal.
If a Mastermind Tactic resurrects this way, shuffle it back into the other face down Tactics.
If a Villain that has ascended to become a Mastermind resurrects this way, it stays a Mastermind and does not reenter the city.

[b]Charge[/b]: "Ambush: Charge one space" means "(After this Villain enters the Sewers,) it charges forward an extra space, pushing other Villains forward."

== Captain America 75th Anniversary ==

[b]Man/Woman Out of Time[/b]: "After you use this card's abilities, set it aside. At the beginning of your next turn, play this card a second time then discard it."
The card is discarded the second time you play it, so you play the card only twice total.
Play your returning Man Out of Time cards after the "Play a Villain Card" part of your turn and before you start playing out your hand.
You "played" a Man Out of Time card on both the first turn you played it and the second turn when you replayed it, so it can help activate your Superpower Abilities on both turns.

[b]Savior[/b]: "Use this ability if you have at least 3 Bystanders in your Victory Pile."
If you defeat a Villain with Bystanders, put those Bystanders into your Victory Pile before checking any Savior ability on that Villain.
If a Hero card rescues a Bystander, that Bystander counts towards any Savior ability on that Hero.

[b]Abomination[/b]: "This Villain gets +Attack equal to the printed Attack of the Hero in the HQ space under this Villain's city space."
"Ultimate Abomination" means "This Mastermind gets +Attack equal to the total printed Attack of all the Heroes in the HQ."
An Abomination Villain's Attack can go up and down as the Villain moves through the city.

== Civil War ==

[b]Divided[/b]
Matching the theme of division and duality, Civil War introduces "Divided Cards," which have two miniature cards printed on the same card.
* You recruit a Divided Card from the HQ as normal by paying its cost. Each side of a Divided Card shows the same cost. (If it costs "3" on each side, you pay only 3 Recruit, not 6.)
* When you play a Divided Card, you choose which side to play. You generate all the Recruit, Attack, and special abilities of that side as normal. You ignore the other side, as if it doesn't exist.
* Each side of a Divided Card has a different Hero Class, like [BGCOLOR=#009933][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Strength[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] or [BGCOLOR=#0000FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Ranged[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]. You can play the [BGCOLOR=#009933][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Strength[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] side to get ready to use a Superpower Ability that triggers on [BGCOLOR=#009933][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Strength[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] cards later in your turn.
* Different sides of Divided Cards often let you choose between Recruit, Attack, drawing cards, and other effects. Choose carefully which side to play!
* While a Divided Card is in your hand or the HQ, it counts as all its Hero Classes, Teams and Hero Names. But once you play it, the card only counts as the side you chose.
* When sorting and setting up, always use the Hero Name on the left side of a Divided Card.
* A Divided Card is one card, not two. So if you have to "discard two cards," "draw two cards," or count the number of cards in your hand, a Divided Card only counts as one card.

[b]Size-Changing[/b]
This keyword represents Heroes and Villains using superpowers to massively change their size.
* Some Hero cards say, "Size-Changing: [BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Covert[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]." This means "You can recruit this card for 2 Recruit less if you played a [BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Covert[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card this turn."
* Likewise, some Villain cards say, "Size-Changing: [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]." This means "You can fight this Villain for 2 Attack less if you played a [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card this turn."
* Some Divided Cards say "Size-Changing: [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]" on one side and "Size-Changing: [BGCOLOR=#009933][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Strength[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]" on the other side. You can recruit either side of the card with its own Size-Changing discount, but you can't get both discounts at once.

[b]Phasing[/b]
This keyword represents Heroes becoming insubstantial and moving through solid objects.
* During your turn, if a card with Phasing is in your hand, you may swap it with the top card of your deck.
* This lets you get a different card instead, save a crucial Phasing card for the next turn, or set up a combo that cares about the top card of your deck.
* Swapping cards this way isn't "playing a card" or "drawing a card," so it doesn't count for other abilities that trigger on those things.

[b]Fortify[/b]
This keyword represents Villains setting up nasty traps for the players.
* Some Villains say things like "Escape: Fortify the Mastermind. While it's fortified, the Mastermind can't be fought."
* Put this Villain on or near the specified place. While it's there, it has the listed effect. Any player can fight that Villain as normal to end that Fortify effect and put that Villain into their Victory Pile.
* If a card would fortify a place, don't do anything if there's already a Villain fortifying that place.

[b]S.H.I.E.L.D. Clearance[/b]
This keyword represents pro-registration S.H.I.E.L.D. forces that can be only defeated with the help of S.H.I.E.L.D. information.
* If a Villain says "S.H.I.E.L.D. Clearance," then you must discard a S.H.I.E.L.D. Hero as an additional cost to fight that Villain.
* Likewise, if a Mastermind has "Double S.H.I.E.L.D. Clearance," then you must discard two S.H.I.E.L.D. Heroes each time you fight them.
* If you are playing with HYDRA Heroes, you may discard them instead of S.H.I.E.L.D. Heroes.

== Deadpool ==

[b]Excessive Violence[/b]
* Once per turn, you can spend one Attack point more than you need to fight a bad guy "using Excessive Violence." If you do, you get to use all the Excessive Violence abilities on Cards you've already played this turn.
* If you've played multiple Heroes (even multiple copies of the same Hero) with the Excessive Violence keyword they would all trigger at the same time. And no, you don't get to save it for later. Stop trying to find loopholes. It's annoying.
* If you fight with Excessive Violence, then draw or play more cards with Excessive Violence abilities later in the turn, it will be too late to use those abilities.
* Some bad guys also have Excessive Violence abilities that let you do something awesome. If you spend one more attack point than you need to fight them, you can do that awesome thing!

[b]Revenge[/b]
* For Villain groups that have the Revenge ability, each Villain gets +1 Attack for every Villain of that group in your Victory Pile.
* Revenge is player specific. It will change based on the damage each player has caused to a Villain group. If you've KO'd 2 members of the Deadpool's 'Friends' Villain group then every other member of that group, that enters or is already in the city, will get +2 Attack during your turns. If another player has yet to KO'd a member of that group then the group doesn't gain any Attack. The more damage YOU do, the more that group hates YOU.
* Revenge is not limited to just Villains either. Masterminds can also hold a grudge. Big surprise there.

== Noir ==

[b]Investigate[/b]
This keyword represents hard-bitten Noir detectives investigating mysteries and searching for evidence and allies.
* Some cards say things like "[b]Investigate[/b] for a [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card." That means "Look at the top two cards of your deck. Reveal a [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card from among them and draw it. Put the rest of those cards back on the top and/or bottom of your deck in any order." Other abilities let you investigate for cards with certain costs, teams, icons, or other traits. (You only get to draw one card even if both cards match the Investigation. If at least one card matches, you must reveal and draw one card.)
* Whether your investigation finds the right kind of card or not, you can still decide which cards go back on the top or bottom of your deck. This lets you set up your next Investigation or make powerful combos with other abilities that care about the top card of your deck. (The cards that that you put back can be broken up between the top and bottom of your deck.)
* Some abilities tell you to investigate entirely different decks, like the Villain, Hero, and Bystander Decks. They will tell you what to do with the card you find. Like before, put the rest of the cards you looked at back on the top and/or bottom of that deck in any order.

[b]Hidden Witness[/b]
This keyword represents Villains and Masterminds hiding behind layers of informants, victims, and stooges. To find these Villains, you must track down and interview Hidden Witnesses who know their locations.
* Some Villains say things like "[b]Ambush:[/b] This Villain captures 2 [b]Hidden Witnesses[/b]." This means the Villain captures the top 2 cards of the Bystander Stack, face-down, as Hidden Witnesses. You can't fight a Villain while it has a Hidden Witness.
* During your turn you can pay 2 Recruit to rescue a Hidden Witness any number of times and put it in your Victory Pile.
* Hidden Witnesses still count as Bystanders. When you rescue one, you get any special "When you rescue this Bystander ..." effect written on it. It stays in your Victory Pile as a normal, face-up Bystander.
* A Villain can have face-up Bystanders and face-down Hidden Witnesses at the same time. You'll need to pay to rescue the face-down Hidden Witnesses. Then, you can fight the Villain, which will automatically rescue the face-up Bystanders.
* If a Villain escapes with any number of Bystanders, including Hidden Witnesses, it will cause all players to discard a single card, just like a Villain escaping with any normal Bystanders. Hidden Witnesses carried away by escaping Villains stay in the Escape Pile as normal, face-up Bystanders.
* You can pay to rescue Hidden Witnesses even if you're not going to fight that Villain during that turn. You can also rescue just some of the Hidden Witnesses and leave others for later.
* If a special ability lets you "Defeat a Villain for free," you automatically rescue all the Hidden Witnesses on it without paying Recruit.
* Masterminds and Schemes can have Hidden Witnesses on them too. They work the same way.

== X-Men ==

[b]X-Gene[/b]: This keyword represents X-Men combining unique mutant powers with their
signature teamwork.
* Some Heroes say things like "X-Gene [BGCOLOR=#0000FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Ranged[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]: You get +2 Attack." This means "If you have a [BGCOLOR=#0000FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Ranged[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card in your discard pile, you get +2 Attack." You can use a card's X-Gene ability only if you have the specified kind of card in your discard pile.
* You can only use a card's X-Gene ability once, no matter how many matching cards you have in your discard pile.
* Remember: when you play a card during your turn, it stays in front of you until the end of turn. Then all the cards you played that turn go to the discard pile. So if you have an empty discard pile, you can't play a [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card from your hand, then immediately play a card with "X-Gene [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]" and use that X-Gene ability.
* One cool combo is to recruit a [BGCOLOR=#009933][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Strength[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Hero into your discard pile, then play your "X-Gene [BGCOLOR=#009933][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Strength[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]" card, and you'll get to use its X-Gene ability.

[b]Piercing Energy[/b]: This keyword represents X-Men using psychic knives & sonic screams to pierce enemy defenses.
* Some Heroes give you a new kind of points called "Piercing Energy," using the Piercing icon. You can fight a Villain or Mastermind by spending Piercing points equal to that enemy's printed Victory Points value (VP). You ignore that enemy's Attack and any Attack modifiers.
* You can also ignore any special conditions for fighting that enemy, automatically rescuing any Human Shields.
* You can't use Piercing Energy against cards that have no printed VP value, like Shadow-X Villains, or Master Strikes that become Villains.

[b]Berserk[/b]: This keyword represents some X-Men going into a berserker rage of unpredictable violence.
* "Berserk" means "Discard the top card of your deck. You get +Attack equal to the discarded card's printed Attack." (So if the discarded card gives "2+ Attack", you just count 2.)
* Some cards say "Berserk, Berserk, Berserk" so you discard three cards in a row.
* Some cards say things like "Berserk. X-Gene [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]: You get +1 Attack." You do the card abilities in order, so Berserk might discard a [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card from your deck, letting you use your X-Gene ability.
* Berserk gives no benefit from discarding printed Recruit or Piercing values.

[b]Soaring Flight[/b]: This ability represents X-Men flying into action as rapid reinforcements.
* "Soaring Flight" means "When you recruit this Hero, set it aside. At the end of this turn, add it to your new hand as an extra card."

[b]Lightshow[/b]: This keyword represents X-Men using fireworks and blinding bursts in spectacular combinations.
* Some Heroes say things like "Lightshow: You get +3 Attack." Once per turn, if you played at least two Lightshow cards this turn, you can use a single Lightshow ability from any of those cards.
* If you play three, four, or more Lightshow cards you still use only a single Lightshow ability.

[b]Dominate[/b]: This keyword represents Villains using telepathy, sorcery, or illusions to twist Heroes' minds to evil.
* Some Villains and Masterminds say they "Dominate" Hero cards from various places. This means "Put those Heroes under this enemy. This enemy gets +1 Attack for each Hero it's Dominating."
* When you fight that enemy, put one of those Dominated Heroes into each player's discard pile. You choose which player gets which Hero, including yourself. There might not be enough for every player to get one. KO any excess Dominated Heroes.
* If a Villain escapes, any Heroes Dominated by that Villain go to the Escape Pile too.

[b]Human Shields[/b]: This keyword represents enemies hiding behind innocent people to prevent Heroes' attacks.
* "Ambush: This Villain captures 2 Human Shields" means the Villain captures the top 2 cards of the Bystander Stack face-down. You can't fight a Villain while it has any Human Shields. During your turn, any number of times, you can pay Attack equal to that Villain's Attack value to rescue one of its Human Shields at random and put it in your Victory Pile. (The * on their Attack is a reminder.)
* A Villain can have face up Bystanders and face-down Human Shields at the same time. You'll need to pay to rescue the face-down Human Shields. Then you can fight the Villain, which will rescue the face-up Bystanders automatically.
* Human Shields still count as Bystanders. Villains escaping with Human Shields still make players discard as normal.

[b]Traps[/b]: The Legendary® X-Men set adds a completely new card type to Legendary®: Traps. Every Villain Group in the set contains at least one Trap.
* When a Trap is played from the Villain Deck, it gives you a challenge to complete this turn to avoid the Trap. If you complete the challenge, put the Trap in your Victory Pile and get its VP. A Trap is not a Villain and doesn't enter the city.
* If you fail to complete the challenge, then at the end of the turn you must KO the trap and suffer the listed consequences! (Do this after you draw a new hand).

[b]Token Cards[/b]: Sometimes game play will cause additional Villains or Masterminds to be added during play. For example, a Master Strike may cause a special Villain to enter the city. Token cards represent these special characters that would otherwise be represented by the card that drew them out. Tokens are all identified by a Token icon in the upper right of the card. These new cards are optional so have fun with them!

== Spider-Man Homecoming ==

[b]Danger Sense[/b]: This keyword represents Spider-Man using his famous "Spider-Sense" superpower to detect danger and evade it. It also covers Tony Stark, Happy Hogan, and Vulture watching for threats and rapidly reacting to them.
* Some cards say things like "Danger Sense 2." This means "Reveal the top 2 cards of the Villain Deck. You get +1 Attack for each Villain you revealed. Put all the cards back on top in any order."
* Cards can say Danger Sense 1, 2, 3, or even 4, revealing that many cards.
* Several Danger Sense cards also say they have additional effects when they reveal particular kinds of cards.
* Sometimes you can use one Danger Sense card to put a particular card on top of the Villain Deck, and then use a different Danger Sense card to benefit from that card being on top of that deck.
* Danger Sense can also be a good way to delay nasty Scheme Twists, Master Strikes, and powerful Villains. But you won't be able to avoid them forever!

[b]Striker[/b]: This keyword represents Villains and Masterminds that get more confident and powerful as the Mastermind smashes Heroes. It means "This gets +1 Attack for each Master Strike in the KO pile and/or stacked next to the Mastermind."
* A couple of Hero cards also have the Striker ability and give you +Attack the same way.
* A couple of cards say "Double Striker," meaning they get +2 Attack per Strike, or even "Triple Striker" meaning +3 Attack per Strike.
By default, most Master Strikes go to the KO pile when they occur. However, some Masterminds specifically put their Master Strikes in unusual places. Striker also counts all face-up Master Strike cards in any of these unusual places. For example, for these Masterminds:
* Galactus - Count Master Strikes in the city.
* Macho Gomez - Count Master Strikes in front of all players.
* Deathbird - Count Master Strikes in the city, Escape Pile, and all players' Victory Piles.
* Mysterio - Count Master Strikes in all players' Victory Piles. Don't count Master Strikes shuffled into his Tactics, since they're not face up.

[b]Coordinate[/b]: This keyword represents how Tony Stark and May Parker act as mentors to Spider-Man in the movie, helping him reach his full potential and become a true hero.
Coordinating allows you to let another player "borrow" one of your cards. It is a critical way to help other players defeat tough enemies. During another player's turn, you can Coordinate with them like this:
* Discard a Coordinate card from your hand and then draw a new card to replace it.
* That player can now play a copy of the card you coordinated with them. (A copy counts as playing the exact same card including its Attack, Recruit, special abilities, and Hero Class symbol.)
You can only Coordinate one card to each player on their turn. However, multiple players can each Coordinate one card to the player whose turn it is, in order to give that player a huge advantage.
* If you are playing a solo game, once per turn, you may discard a card with Coordinate to draw a card.
* Coordinate is printed on cards in red text to make it easier to notice during other players' turns.
* When you offer to Coordinate a card to another player, that player can decline. If so, you don't discard that card and that player doesn't play a copy of it.
* If you are playing with the Final Showdown, you can't Coordinate during that Showdown.

== Champions ==

[b]Cheering Crowds[/b]: This keyword represents the Champions being inspired to redouble their efforts by adoring fans.
* Several Hero cards say "Cheering Crowds." This means "You may play this card twice in a row if you return a Bystander from your Victory Pile to the bottom of the Bystander Stack."
[u]Example 1[/u]: Say you have a Hero that gives 1 Recruit and says "Draw a card. [b]Cheering Crowds[/b]." As you play this Hero, you could return a Bystander to play the Hero twice in a row, getting 2 Recruit and drawing two cards.
* Essentially you play the card itself, and then you play a bonus copy of that card.
[u]Example 2[/u]: Say your first play of the turn was an [BGCOLOR=#CC9900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Instinct[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card that gives 2 Attack and says "[BGCOLOR=#CC9900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Instinct[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]: Draw a card. [b]Cheering Crowds[/b]." You decide to return a Bystander to play this card twice in a row. The first play wouldn't get to use the "[BGCOLOR=#CC9900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Instinct[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]: Draw a card" ability, since you haven't played an [BGCOLOR=#CC9900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Instinct[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card earlier in the turn. However, the second play would get to use that Superpower ability, since you have now played an [BGCOLOR=#CC9900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Instinct[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card earlier in the turn. So you would end up getting 4 Attack and drawing one card.
* If you had played a different [BGCOLOR=#CC9900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Instinct[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card before doubling the Cheering Crowds card, then you could would get to use the "[BGCOLOR=#CC9900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Instinct[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]: Draw a card" ability both times, getting 4 Attack and drawing two cards.
[u]Example 3[/u]: Say your first play is using Cheering Crowds to play a [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card twice. Then, you play another card that says "[BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]: You get +1 Attack for each other [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Hero you played this turn." That ability would count both plays of your Cheering Crowds card, giving you +2 Attack total.
* When playing out a big turn, some people like to put the Bystander they're returning temporarily on the Cheering Crowds card to remind themselves they've played it twice.
...
* If you use Cheering Crowds to play a [b]Versatile[/b] card twice, you could get Recruit with one play and get Attack with the other play, or choose the same for both.

[b]Size-Changing[/b]: This keyword represents Heroes and Villains using superpowers to stretch or massively change their size. It's also used by characters that can change the size of a weapon, technology, or energy. It first appeared in [i]Legendary: Civil War[/i], but in this set it has a new twist.
...
* As a new Twist, some Heroes and Villains in this set say things like "[b]Size-Changing[/b]: [BGCOLOR=#009933][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Strength[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR], [BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Covert[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]." If you played any [BGCOLOR=#009933][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Strength[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Heroes this turn, the cost is 2 less. If you played any [BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Covert[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Heroes, the cost is 2 less. If you played both a [BGCOLOR=#009933][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Strength[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Hero and a [BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Covert[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Hero this turn, then the cost is 4 less.
* Fin Fang From and one of his Monsters Unleashed even say "[b]Size-Changing[/b]: [BGCOLOR=#009933][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Strength[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR], [BGCOLOR=#CC9900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Instinct[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR], [BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Covert[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR], [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR], [BGCOLOR=#0000FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Ranged[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]". You can pay 2 Attack less to fight them for each of these Hero Classes you played this turn.
* [u]Note[/u]: For any Size-Changing card, it doesn't matter how many Heroes you played -- it only maters whether or not you played any Heroes of that Hero class.
* After you've recruited a card, Size-Changing doesn't do anything else on that card.
* If a Hero in the HQ already has "[b]Size-Changing[/b]: [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]" and it gains "[b]Size-Changing[/b]: [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR], [BGCOLOR=#0000FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Ranged[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]" from another special ability like the Sporr Villain, it just ends up with "[b]Size-Changing[/b]: [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR], [BGCOLOR=#0000FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Ranged[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]." A card can't have Size-Changing for the same Hero Class twice.


== World War Hulk ==

[b]Transform[/b]: This keyword represents the themes of duality and transformation in Hulk stories.
[u]Heroes[/u]:
* Each Hero in this set has some special "Transformed" cards that go along with it. When you use these Heroes, [b]don't[/b] shuffle their "Transformed" cards into the Hero Deck. Instead, set them aside in a special Transformation Pile. You can't recruit cards from this pile. Instead, you transform other cards into them.
* Some Hero cards like "Bruce Banner: Gamma Ray Experiments" say things like "...Transform this into Savage Hulk Unleashed."
* When you play a Hero card that says it transforms into another card, you complete all effects on the card you played and get its normal Recruit and Attack.
* Then remove the transforming card from the game (putting it in the Transformation Pile) and put the newly transformed card into your hand instead (from the Transformation Pile). You can play the new Transformed card immediately that same turn.
* You still count as having played the transforming card you played and removed from the game, including effects like "You get +1 Attack for each [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card you played this turn." But if an effect asks you to reveal one of your cards, you can only reveal the new, transformed card, not the old card that you removed from the game.
* Some transforming cards tell you to put the new card on top of your deck or in your discard pile instead.
* You can look through the Transformation Pile at any time.
* At the end of the game, store a Hero's Transformed cards with the rest of that Hero's cards. To start a game, you only need to bring out the Transformed cards for the Heroes you're using. Don't bring out all the Transformed cards in the entire game.
* If you sleeve your cards, you can put the Transformed version of the card in the same sleeve, behind the Transforming card. When it's time to transform, you just pull the back card to the front of the sleeve. It's a little thicker in the sleeve, but it still shuffles well.

[u]Masterminds[/u]: Each Mastermind in this set is a double-sided "Transforming Mastermind" that transforms back and forth between two forms during the game.
* The side with the "Always Leads" ability starts face up.
* When a Master Strike or Mastermind Tactic ability occurs, it will tell you to "Transform" the Mastermind, meaning flip it over to its other side. (Don't also do the Master Strike ability of the new side.)
* A Mastermind only uses the abilities and Attack of its currently face up side. Ignore the special abilities and values on the currently face down side.

[b]Outwit[/b]: This keyword represents how Bruce Banner, Amadeus Cho, the Illuminati, and the Intelligencia are among the smartest characters in the Marvel universe.
* Some Heroes say things like "Outwit: Draw a card."
* [b]You can use this Outwit ability only if you reveal Heroes with 3 different costs.[/b]
* You can count the Outwit card itself. So you can reveal a 2-cost Hero in your hand, plus a 6-cost Outwit card and 0-cost S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Hero you already played.
* Some Villains and Masterminds also say they get stronger or harm you in special ways if you fail to Outwit them. For example: "[b]Ambush:[/b] If you can't Outwit the Leader, play the top card of the Villain Deck."
* You can choose not to Outwit, even if you are able.

[b]Smash[/b]: This keyword represents how when Hulks get angry, they SMASH hard, no matter what they have to toss aside.
* Some Heroes say things like "Smash 3." This means [b]"You may discard another card from your hand. If you do, you get +3 Attack."[/b]

[b]Wounded Fury[/b]: This keyword represents how wounding a Hulk often just makes it ANGRIER and STRONGER! It also includes Villains attacking with more furious bloodlust as they wound you.
* When a Hero card says "Wounded Fury", it means [b]"You get +1 Attack for each Wound in your discard pile."[/b]
* Likewise, when a Villain or Mastermind says "Wounded Fury", it means [b]"It gets +1 Attack for each Wound in your discard pile."[/b]

[b]Cross-Dimensional Rampage[/b]: As different Hulks rampage across planets and dimensions, only another Hulk can stop them! This keyword debuted in Legendary: Secret Wars.
* "Cross-Dimensional Hulk Rampage" means [b]"Each player reveals one of their Hulk Heroes or a Hulk card in their Victory Pile or gains a Wound."[/b]
* You can reveal any card that includes the word "Hulk" in its card name, Hero name, Villain Group name, or Tactics for Hulk Masterminds. This includes any Red Hulk, She-Hulk, Red She-Hulk, Skaar, Son of Hulk, Joe Fixit Grey Hulk, Hulkling, Hulk Gang, Cosmic Hulk Robot, Hulkbuster, Enchain the Hulk, and so on.
* You don't need to know the whole history of Marvel comics to judge who counts as a Hulk – just rely on whether the card says Hulk in its name or not. There are only a few, very specific exceptions we have to make to stay true to the characters:
** "Nul, Breaker of Worlds" from Fear Itself and "Maestro" (core set) count as Hulks for this.
** "Weapon X" and "Old Man Logan" count as Wolverines for "Cross-Dimensional Wolverine Rampage" in other sets.
* Some Heroes in this set can transform into Hulks, like Bruce Banner and Amadeus Cho. A puny "Bruce Banner" card doesn't say "Hulk" on it, so it can't stop a Hulk Rampage. But revealing the transformed Bruce Banner card named "Savage Hulk Unleashed" works.
* When a Cross-Dimensional Hulk Rampage happens, you can choose to gain the Wound, even if you have a Hulk that you already played or could otherwise reveal. You might want the Wound if you have Wounded Fury cards.
* There are also Cross-Dimensional Void Rampages, etc.

== Marvel Studios Phase 1 ==

[b]Conqueror[/b]
Some Villain cards have a special ability called "Conqueror," representing their desire to conquer and hold a specific part of the city. For example, the Chitauri Soldier Villain has the ability "[b]Rooftops Conqueror 2.[/b]" This ability means This Villain gets [b]+2[/b] [Attack] while any Villain is in the rooftops." So the Chitauri Soldier gets this [Attack] bonus while it itself on the Rooftops, or when a completely different Villain is on the Rooftops. The Chitauri Soldier doesn't care if the Villain on the Rooftops has a Conqueror ability or not. Other Villains and the Iron Monger Mastermind have different Conqueror abilities, with different [Attack] bonus numbers and referring to different city spaces.

== Ant-Man ==

[b]Size-Changing[/b]
This keyword represents Heroes and Villains using superpowers to shrink, grow, or massively change their size. It's also used by characters that can change the size of a weapon, technology, or energy. It first debuted in [i]Legendary Civil War[/i] and also appeared in [i]Legendary Champions[/i].

* Some Hero cards say things like "Size-Changing [BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Covert[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]." This means [b]"You can recruit this card for 2 Recruit less if you played any [BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Covert[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] cards this turn."[/b]
* Likewise, some Villain cards say things like "Size-Changing [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]." This means [b]"You can fight this Villain for 2 Attack less if you played any [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] cards this turn."[/b]
* Note: For a typical Size-Changing card, it doesn't matter how many Heroes of that Hero Class you played – it only matters if you played any Heroes of that Hero Class or not.
* After you've recruited a card, Size-Changing doesn't do anything else on that card.

[b]Microscopic Size-Changing[/b]
Far beyond other Heroes that can stretch or grow, Ant-Man and Wasp can change their size to a whole new scale. They can shrink down smaller than an atom, to the quantum Microverse. Here, the very laws of physics can be broken and even reversed! This ability works like regular Size- Changing, but with a couple of twists.
* Some Heroes and Villains in this set say things like "Microscopic Size-Changing [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]. "
* This means [b]"You can recruit this card for 2 Recruit less for each [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card you played this turn, counting up to three [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] cards."[/b]
* So if you played one [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Hero this turn, this card costs 2 less. If you played two [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Heroes, it costs 4 less. If you played three or more [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Heroes, it costs 6 less.
* Playing a fourth [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card wouldn’t [b]reduce this cost any further since there are only three [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] icons listed in this particular Microscopic Size- Changing ability.
* The second twist is that Microscopic Size- Changing can actually reduce a card’s Recruit cost to zero or even a negative number![/b] When you recruit a Microscopic Size-Changing Hero with a negative cost, [b]you actually gain that many Recruit points[/b]!
* Some Villains also have Microscopic Size- Changing. It works the same way, letting you fight that Villain for 2 Attack less for each card of the correct color you played this turn, counting up to the number of icons shown in the Microscopic Size-Changing ability.
* Likewise, if you fight a Villain with Microscopic Size-Changing and reduce its Attack value to a negative number, you actually gain that many Attack points when you fight it. You don’t even need to have any Attack points before you fight them.
* For example, say you play five [BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Covert[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Heroes, then fight a Villain with 3 Attack and "Microscopic Size-Changing [BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Covert[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] [BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Covert[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] [BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Covert[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] [BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Covert[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]." The Villain's Attack decreases to -5, and you actually gain 5 Attack when you fight them! (The 5th [BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Covert[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Hero you played didn’t reduce the Attack, since the Microscopic Size- Changing ability only had 4 icons.)
* Building the right deck and shrinking down to the crazy backwards physics of the Microverse can create some very powerful turns!

[b]Empowered[/b]
This keyword represents Heroes and Villains who
draw power from ambient energy, technology, or
superpowers around them.
* Some Heroes say things like "You get [b]Empowered[/b] by [BGCOLOR=#009933][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Strength[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]." This means [b]"You get +1 Attack for each [BGCOLOR=#009933][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Strength[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card in the HQ."[/b]
* Likewise, some Villains and Masterminds say things like "[b]Empowered[/b] by [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]". This means [b]"This gets +1 Attack for each [BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Tech[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card in the HQ."[/b]
* As cards enter and leave the HQ, an Empowered card can get stronger or weaker. You only check the Attack bonus at the moment you play your Empowered Hero or at the moment you fight the Empowered enemy.
* One clever move is to recruit a Hero from the HQ at the right time, changing the colors in the HQ to weaken an Empowered enemy or try to strengthen an Empowered Hero in your hand.
* Some cards are even "Double Empowered" or "Triple Empowered" meaning that they get +2 Attack or +3 Attack for each appropriate card in the HQ.
* (A multicolored or divided card from other sets counts if either half is the correct color. For example, an "Empowered by [BGCOLOR=#0000FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Ranged[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] and [BGCOLOR=#009933][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Strength[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]" ability can get +1 Attack from a [BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Covert[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] [BGCOLOR=#0000FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Ranged[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card or from a [BGCOLOR=#CC9900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Instinct[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] [BGCOLOR=#009933][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Strength[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] card. However, a "[BGCOLOR=#0000FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Ranged[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] [BGCOLOR=#009933][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Strength[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]" card in the HQ would only give +1 Attack, not +2 Attack.)

[b]Chivalrous Duel[/b]
This keyword represents how Morgan le Fay and the knights of her "Queen's Vengeance" hail from a realm of honorable single combat. You can't gang up on an enemy in a Chivalrous Duel – you have to pick just one Hero Name to duel the enemy.
* [b]To fight an enemy with "Chivalrous Duel," you can only use Attack from a single Hero Name.[/b]
* For example, to fight a 3 Attack Villain with Chivalrous Duel, you can spend 3 Attack from two different Black Knight hero cards. But you can't combine 2 Attack from Black Knight cards and 1 Attack from a Wasp card.
* If a Hero like "S.H.I.E.L.D. Trooper" doesn't have a Hero Name listed, then its Hero Name is the same as its card name. So you can play three S.H.I.E.L.D. Troopers then fight a 3 Attack Villain with Chivalrous Duel. But you can't spend 2 Attack from Black Knight cards and 1 Attack from a S.H.I.E.L.D. Trooper to fight an enemy with Chivalrous Duel.
* (You can't use Attack you get from anything that's not a Hero card, including Microscopic Size-Changing Villains, Mastermind Tactics, Shard tokens from other sets, etc. You can use Attack from Hero Artifacts in other sets with the right Hero Name, since those are Hero cards.)
* In a setup with lots of Chivalrous Duels, like fighting Morgan le Fay or the Scheme "Pull Earth into Medieval Times," you will want to build your deck to concentrate your Attack cards into just one or two Hero Names!
